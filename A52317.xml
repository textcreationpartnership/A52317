         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The blinde clothes are called<note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 56. Matth. 15. &amp; 22. Luke 6.</note>

And although one ſhould take away the clothes from their eyes, in the ſame Land of Ignorance, and ſo ſhould open their eyes in the knowledg, yet might it not help them any thing at all, to a behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the true Light; but it ſhould be unto them more evil then good, becauſe of the darkneſſes<note n="d" place="margin">Job 10.12.

               <p n="6">6. And although now one ſhould ſpeak much of the light, to any of the blinde people (in the Land, called <hi>Ignorance</hi>) and ſhould in moſt evident maner, expound or open the ſame unto them, in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and that they then ſhould have no luſt nor will, to depart out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Ignorance; neither yet to be taught, nor led to the true light of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right life: So could it not doubtleſs profit them, to the entrance into the reſt of life; but it ſhould be unto them, much more to a diſquietneſs, to an offence, and to a death, becauſe they remain inhabiting in the Land and in the City of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> For the whole City of the ſame Land, is full of Ignorance.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100894:13"/>For that cauſe alſo ſhe hath her name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſhe is her ſelf.</p>

Verily, that the ſame councel, is the beſt councel to be uſed among the blinde people that know not their error, I have ſufficiently proved by experience, among thoſe that are ignorant of their error, and among the decliners from us, and our godly doctrine. Let every one therefore, take

               <p>IN this ſame thorowfaring land, men find alſo a crafty murderer, that both high and low, wide and farr runneth all over this ſame land, and he is named<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 13. and 14.</note>

               <p n="2">2. Of this wicked Villain, it behoveth us to be<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 3.4.</note> very wary; for by him there are many murdered, and ſo they remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Reſt, becauſe they loſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and forſake the Croſs through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; and alſo, becauſe they cover their eyes from the Light of heaven, and will no longer behold the Leading Star.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore herein there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to paſs thorow, namely, for all thoſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100894:31"/>that will follow their own counſel, and are<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 13. and 14.</note> fainthearted, or wavering in faith, keeping no diligent watch unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and (for fear of ſuſtaining damage) do haſtily caſt the Croſs from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the travellers that give no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto their own counſel or opinion, ſhall not fear the danger of ſuſtaining damage, but ſhall continue of<note n="d" place="margin">Ephe. 6.</note> good courage: for it is all nothing and vanity, whatſoever meeteth them upon the way. It is all to be overcome through the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for there through it conſumeth it ſelf,<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 37.68.</note> like unto ſmoke, and there is nothing at all found that is any-what, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth over but the good land, with his holy Inhabitants and godly Riches.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore let men travel thorow boldly<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 5. and 10. and 11.</note> with faith and a firm hope, and not doubt<note n="g" place="margin">Matt 14.</note> nor grow wavering: then is there nothing that can endamage nor deſtroy them.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100894:38"/>them ſo captive (with deceit) that they will in no wiſe depart out of it, and alſo becauſe that the inward pride, and the ſtout lofty minde in the knowledg, is too deep rooted in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The people of this land are a ſtrange, wilde, rebellious, and ſeditious people, and<note n="d" place="margin">Bar. 3.</note> are a people divided in minde, and grounded upon many kinde of grounds proceeding our of the Knowledg.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100894:39"/>they caſt down one anothers work, and turn up the foundation of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For whoſoever there hath the higheſt mounting knowledg, or is the richeſt of ſpirit, or hath the moſt eloquent utterance of ſpeech,<note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> he can there bear the ſway, or get the chief praiſe, and can overthrow many other infirm foundations and works which are alſo vain, but can ſhew no<note n="e" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> love to the unity of heart, in the good beeing of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And now when any mans foundation or work is overthrown through any maner of knowledg, then is the ſame a great delight and glory unto the other that getteth the victory, and to an advancement of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For that is the careful diligence that they uſe among each other,<note n="f" place="margin">Num. 14 16.</note> as how the one may (with the knowledg) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the others foundation, building, and work, and to bring him into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt among others, whereby to enlarge their own knowledg, building, or work, and to make the ſame great or commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But whoſoever hath his foundation and work overthrown, the comfort of his heart is taken away, and he falleth into
